[Are You Sure You Want to Use MMAP in Your Database Management System?](https://db.cs.cmu.edu/papers/2022/cidr2022-p13-crotty.pdf)

*Abstract*: Since developers keep trying to use mmap in new DBMSs, we wrote this paper to provide a warning to others that mmap is not a suitable replacement for a traditional buffer pool. We discuss the main shortcomings of mmap in detail, and our experimental analysis demonstrates clear performance limitations. Based on these findings, we conclude with a prescription for when DBMS developers might consider using mmap for file I/O.
