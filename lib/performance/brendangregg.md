[Brendan Gregg Books Recommendations](https://www.brendangregg.com/books.html)

*Abstract*: I've been asked for textbook recommendations from time to time, which I've been sharing on this page. I'll keep this list up to date as I finish reading more books that I'd recommend. Note that this is not a list of all the books I own, but rather, only those I'd recommend. I've worked in programming, system administration, computer security, and for a while I've now focused on computer performance. My bookshelf reflects my career.
