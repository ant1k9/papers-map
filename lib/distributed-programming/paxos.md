*Abstract*: Recent archaeological discoveries on the island of Paxos reveal that the parliament functioned despite the peripatetic propensity of its part-time legislators. The legislators maintained consistent copies of the parliamentary record, despite their frequent forays from the chamber and the forgetfulness of their messengers. The Paxon parliamentâ€™s protocol provides a new way of implementing the state-machine approach to the design of distributed systems.
